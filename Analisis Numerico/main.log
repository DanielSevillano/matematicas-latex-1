I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

capitulo3.tex:226: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.226 \end{align*}
                  
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

capitulo3.tex:226: Missing } inserted.
<inserted text> 
                }
l.226 \end{align*}
                  
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
